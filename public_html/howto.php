			<h3>Frequently asked questions.<br/><small>(What's this all for, anyway?)</small></h3>
	        <ol class="biglist reveal">
	            <li>Who started this project?</li>
	            <p class="answer">This project began at the Detroit Collaborative Design Center as a set of printed guides designed by Ceara O'Leary during her Enterprise Rose Fellowship at DCDC. The guides were a big hit, so Ceara had the idea to create an interactive website so that others could create and share guides for their communities. That idea became this website, which was designed and built by Andrea Hansen and Patrick Stowe Jones, and generously funded by Enterprise Community Partners and the Surna Foundation.</p>

	            <li>Are these guides copyright protected?</li>
	            <p class="answer">All of the content on this site, including the guides, is protected by the MIT Open Source License. The following copyright notice is included on each guide, and may not be removed or altered:<br/><br/>

				<br/>
				<br/>
				</p>

				<li>Do the guides have to be related to social impact?</li>
	            <p class="answer">No! We welcome how-to guides of all kinds. For instance, you might want to make a guide related to design, transportation, education, advocacy, public space, etc. They can be as general or specific as you like, but should have something to do with community building. When in doubt, you can <a href="contact.php">contact us.</a></p>

	            <li>Can I upload my own guide?</li>
	            <p class="answer">Yes! If you'd like to upload your own guide, use our <a href="create.php">creation tool.</a> After your guide is complete and you have published it, it will automatically be added to the library with the tags you've selectedâ€”unless you elected to keep it private.<br/><br/>If you prefer, we also have Adobe InDesign <a href="template.indd">templates</a> available (right click link to download). The guides created with these templates cannot be uploaded to the library at this time, so we recommend using our creation tool for easy shareability.</p>

	            <li>Do you approve guides before they show up in the library?</li>
	            <p class="answer">We don't. We rely on our users to be responsible citizens and upload quality content only. However, we do periodically review the guides uploaded by our community, and reserve the right to remove any inappropriate material.</p>

	            <li>Why do I need to register in order to download guides?</li>
	            <p class="answer">In exchange for allowing you to use and share our content, we'd like to get just a little bit of information from you. To download and share guides, you don't need to register, but we would like to get your name, email address, and zip code. We promise we will NEVER sell your information&mdash;it's just for us to keep tabs on how the guides are being used!</p>

			<p>In this section, we'll use one of the first guides we ever made to demonstrate the features of a how-to guide, as well as to offer some suggestions on what takes a guide from good to great.

						<span id="tour1" class="simptip-position-top simptip-fade simptip-smooth simptip-multiline" data-tooltip="1. Title. A good title should be short and to the point. Use action verbs and avoid obscure vocabulary, unless your guide is specifically targeted to an audience that knows what you are referencing."><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span>
						<span id="tour2" class="simptip-position-top simptip-fade simptip-smooth simptip-multiline" data-tooltip="2. Description. What will the user learn from the guide? Who benefits from this guide, and how is it useful? Are there any important terms you need to define upfront?

						<span id="tour3" class="simptip-position-top simptip-fade simptip-smooth simptip-multiline" data-tooltip="3. Key Image. A good key image describes your guide's intentions instantly. Good graphics should show, not tell: use arrows and symbols to explain your process. Sometimes a photo, chart, or graph can suffice, but make sure that what is happening in the image is easily recognizable."><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></span>
						<span id="tour4" class="simptip-position-top simptip-fade simptip-smooth simptip-multiline" data-tooltip="4. Steps. Take a moment to break down your overall goal into bite-sized steps. Rather than multi-step tasks, these steps should be simple to understand and easy to accomplish in a reasonable amount of time.
